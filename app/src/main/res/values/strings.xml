        Welcome to Remember Here!\n\n
        To start, click the add button in the bottom right and then add your location details.
         Click Use current Location to use your current GPS Position - this requires GPS to be enabled.
         Click save, and it will appear in the list of locations. Clicking on the location will open up a menu, so you can view the location info, and either navigate to the location, edit the location, or delete it. To delete a location, press edit, then press delete.\n\n
         As this is a free app, there are adverts, but these can be disabled in the About page - this costs the absolute minimum ($1 / 60p) but helps to support us.\n\n
         Thank you for using Remember Here!
